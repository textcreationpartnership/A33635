         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore then it was conſidered in the ſaid Court here, that the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> by occaſion of the Outlawry aforeſaid ſhould not be be moleſted, or troubled, but ſhould go thereof acquitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the Record thereof in the ſaid Court here remaining fully appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And ſo, the ſaid <hi>John Drury</hi> ſaith, That there is not any ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Outlawry aforeſaid, as the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> by his Writ and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration aforeſaid above ſuppoſeth. And this he is ready to aver, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he prayeth Judgement, if he from execution of his Debt aforeſaid and damages aforeſaid againſt the aforeſaid <hi>Owen</hi> ought to be barred, &amp;c. and the aforeſaid <hi>Owin</hi> ſaith, that the aforeſaid plea of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>John</hi> in form aforeſaid above pleaded is not ſufficient in Law to the ſaid <hi>John</hi> his execution by Colour of the Iudgment aforeſaid to have, and maintain, and that he to that plea in manner and form aforeſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove pleaded, needs not, nor by the Law of the Land is bound to anſwer; and this he is ready to aver, wherefore for default of ſufficient plea of the aforeſaid <hi>John</hi> in this behalf, the ſaid <hi>Owen,</hi> as at firſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Iudgement; and that the ſaid <hi>John</hi> from his execution by colour of the Iudgment aforeſaid be barred; and that the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> be thereof char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp;c. and the aforeſaid <hi>John</hi> in as much as he ſufficient matter in Law to him the ſaid <hi>John</hi> his execution by colour of the Iudgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid againſt the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> to have, and maintain above hath alleged, which he is ready to aver, which matter the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> doth not deny nor to the ſame any waies anſwereth, but the ſaid averrant altogether refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, as before, prayeth ludgement, and execution of his Debt and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages aforeſaid againſt the ſaid <hi>Owyn</hi> to him to be adjuged, &amp;c. and becauſe the Iuſtices here will aviſe themſelves of and upon the premiſes before that they give their Iudgement thereof, Day is given to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aforeſaid until the morrow of the Holy Trynity to hear their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the ſame Iuſtices here, thereof are not yet, &amp;c.</p>
